IMA Event Log
----------------

IMA Log Verification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An IMA verifier implementation should note several differences from
verifying a pre-OS log. They occur because IMA measurements can occur
during the attestation.

-  An IMA event log append is not atomic with the TPM extend.

Since a TPM quote can intervene, the event log can have extra events.
There will never be a missing quoted event because the append comes
before the extend.

Further, an append-extend pair is atomic with other append-extend pairs,
so the appends will never be out of order with the extends.

-  A TPM quote is not atomic with a TPM PCR read.

A PCR read before or after a quote may not reflect the quoted PCR.

-  IMA event logs are far larger than pre-OS logs.

While a pre-OS log may hold 50 events, an IMA log can hold 10K â€“ 100K
events.

For the above reasons, a verifier should consider the following
recommendations.

#. The verifier should account for extra events.

   Replay the event log until the quote matches and then discard extra
   events. Extra events are not a failure.

#. It is futile to read the IMA PCR (PCR 10) and send it to the
   verifier.

   Since it is not atomic with the quote or the event log, a mismatch is
   not a failure.

   Looping through quote / PCR read cycles until the quote matches the PCR
   read will lead to poor performance and perhaps timeouts, especially
   early when IMA is measuring many files.

#. Design for incremental attestations.

   Until a reboot, the IMA event log receives only appends. Once the
   earlier measurements are verified, there is no need to verify them
   again. The verified PCR 10 value serves as state.

   For a long lived platform, eventually most files will be measured and
   few or no new events need be processes.

Multiple PCRs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The IMA subsystem is adding a hook ima_measure_critical_data() to
measure integrity critical data beyond file hashes and signatures.
Examples are:

-  an SELinux policy

-  kernel information such as the kernel version

This hook does the event append / extend, optionally to a PCR other than
PCR 10. The payload is added to the **same** IMA event log.

Why is this important?

If the additional data used a separate event log, the verifier would
replay multiple event logs, each of which could have extra events.
Calculating the quoted PCR digest would be difficult.

Because there is only one event log, and because each append / extend
operation is atomic with other pairs, the verification algorithm does
not change: replay the event log until the calculated PCR digest matches
that of the quote.

.. _ima-event-log-location:

IMA Event Log Location
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Linux kernel creates and writes the IMA Event Log (also known as
the measurement list or integrity log) pseudofiles.

There are two formats:

* The :ref:`ima-event-log-binary-format` is at
  ``/sys/kernel/security/ima/binary_runtime_measurements``. 

* The :ref:`ima-event-log-ascii-format` is at
  ``/sys/kernel/security/ima/ascii_runtime_measurements``.

In newer kernels, the logs are at:
``/sys/kernel/security/integrity/ima/binary_runtime_measurements``
and
``/sys/kernel/security/integrity/ima/ascii_runtime_measurements``.
``/sys/kernel/security/ima``
is linked to
``/sys/kernel/security/integrity/ima``
for backward compatibility.

Normally, systemd mounts securityfs in the kernel. It is possible that
this pseudofile will not exist because securityfs is not
mounted. Remedy this by adding this line to ``/etc/fstab``:

::

   none /sys/kernel/security securityfs defaults 0 0

I.e.,

* filesystem
  none
* mount point
  /sys/kernel/security
* type
  securityfs
* options
  defaults
* dump
  0
* pass
  0

``mount`` should show

::

	securityfs on /sys/kernel/security type securityfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)

The first reader is typically an attestation application, which sends
the log along with a quote (a signature over the event log) to a
verifier.

The attestation application sends log records to a verifier.  There is
currently no standard transmission format.  The format must at least
provide means to recreate the original record so that hashes can be
verified. The verifier validates the log against the quote signature.

IMA Event Log Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This details the binary IMA event log format, field by field.

Multi-byte integer values (PCR index, length, etc.) are in the byte
order of the host where the event log was created. The sender can
convert to network byte order before transmission, as long as the values
are not hashed. For values that are hashed, the receiver must know the
byte order.

Sizes and lengths are always in bytes.

Fields are always concatenated with no padding.

The log has no specified maximum number of records. A faulty policy
that measures rapidly changing files like /var/log can have 100,000's
of records.  A reasonable policy will have about 5000 entries at boot
and can grow to 100,000 over time based on usage.

.. _ima-event-log-ascii-format:

IMA Event Log Ascii Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

   FIXME document the ascii format.

.. _ima-event-log-binary-format:

IMA Event Log Binary Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An IMA event record has the following fields.

PCR Index
^^^^^^^^^

This is a 4-byte integer representing the PCR Index.

The default value is PCR 10.  See :ref:`config-ima-measure-pcr-idx`
and the policy rule condition :ref:`pcr-value`.

Due to :ref:`pcr-value`, the event log may contain events that have
not been extended.  E.g., the event log may contain PCR 17 or PCR 24.


Template Hash
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is normally a 20-byte SHA-1 hash of the Template Data field. It can
also be all zeros.

   Exception: For the ``ima`` template name, the Template Hash is a SHA-1
   hash of the File Data Hash field and the File Name padded with zero
   bytes to a length of 256 bytes. The File Name Length field is not
   hashed.

An all zeros hash indicates a measurement log violation.  IMA is
invalidating an entry.  Trust in entries after that are up to end
user. Cases include:

* if the policy rule includes :ref:`digest-type` ``=verity`` and the
  fs-verity digest is not present.

* if one process opens for read while another has it open for write.

There is no associated length or descriptor.

There are currently two PCR extend schemes. This document calls them
Type 1 and Type 2 because there is no defacto term in use.

PCR Extend Type 1 (zero pad)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

-  PCR SHA-1 Bank

If the Template Hash is not all zeros, it is used directly in the extend
operation.

If the Template Hash is all zeros, an all ones digest is extended.

-  PCR SHA-256 Bank

The SHA-256 bank is extended with the SHA-1 value (the Template Hash or
all ones) padded with 12 bytes of zero.

PCR Extend Type 2 (hash)
''''''''''''''''''''''''

-  PCR SHA-1 Bank

Same as Type 1.

-  PCR SHA-256 (and other non SHA-1 banks)

If the Template Hash is not all zeros, the bank is extended with the
hash of the Template Data field. See the exception in `Template Hash`_.

If the Template Hash is all zeros, the bank is extended with all ones to
the length of the hash algorithm,

Template Name Length
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a 4-byte integer representing the length of the Template Name
field.

Question: What is the maximum length?

Template Name
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a printable string representing the template name.

The string is NOT nul terminated. It is guaranteed to be printable.

For legal names, see :ref:`template-data-fields`.

Template Data Length
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a 4-byte integer representing the length of the Template Data
field.

   Note that there is redundancy, in that the data fields are
   self-describing. This can be checked for consistency.

.. _template-data:

Template Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

See `Template Data Fields`_ for the contents of this field.

The template is specified in this order:

* Compile time :ref:`config-ima-default-template`
* Boot time :ref:`template-specifiers`
* Policy rule :ref:`template`

.. _built-in-templates:

Built-in Templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The predefined / built-in template names below can be

* compiled in with :ref:`config-ima-default-template`
* specified with :ref:`boot-command-line-arguments`
* specified within a policy rule using :ref:`template`

``|`` is the concatenation symbol.

.. _template-data-fields:

Template Data Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Template data can have the following fields. Unless specified, each is
preceded by a 4-byte length.  Each entry is separated by a ``|``
character and no spaces.

What happens if a field appears multiple times?


.. _d:

d
^^^^^^

``d`` is 20-byte digest, SHA-1 or zero padded MD-5 (no length)

.. _d-ng:

d-ng
^^^^^^

``d-ng`` is a :ref:`hash-length` + :ref:`hash-algorithm` +
:ref:`file-data-hash`.


The :ref:`file-data-hash` is similar to :ref:`d-modsig`. The hash
input includes the appended signature if present in the file.

   Note: A file signature verifier should use a hash of the file
   excluding the appended signature.

.. _hash-length:

Hash Length
'''''''''''''''''

This is a 4-byte integer representing the combined length of the
:ref:`hash-algorithm` and :ref:`file-data-hash` fields. Those fields
do not have explicit lengths.

.. _hash-algorithm:

Hash Algorithm
'''''''''''''''''

This is a string representing the hash algorithm of the
File Data Hash field. The values are the same as those
of :ref:`ima-hash` in the :ref:`boot-command-line-arguments`.

In the event log, the algorithm is followed by a ``:`` and a nul
terminator.

   Note this redundancy, which can be checked for consistency:

-  The Hash Length minus the length of the Hash Algorithm field
   (including the nul terminator) yields the size of the File Data Hash.

-  The length of a hash based on the Hash Algorithm yields the size of
   the File Data Hash.

.. _file-data-hash:

File Data Hash
''''''''''''''

This is a hash of the file data. It can be either the IMA digest (a
digest of the entire file) or the fs-verity digest.


   Note that the fs-verity digest can also include an appended signature.

For :ref:`d-ng` and :ref:`d-ngv2`, the hash input includes an appended signature, if
present. Therefore, it cannot be used to verify the signature sig_ of a
file with an appended signature.

For :ref:`d-modsig`, the hash input does not include the appended signature.
It can be used to verify the signature sig_ of a file with an appended
signature.

The length and hash algorithm are determined by the :ref:`hash-algorithm`
field.

.. _d-modsig:
  
d-modsig
^^^^^^^^^^^^

``d-modsig`` is a :ref:`hash-length` + :ref:`hash-algorithm` +
:ref:`file-data-hash`. It is similar to d-ng_, but the input to the
:ref:`file-data-hash` omits the appended signature. It is used to
verify the appended signature.

   Note: In order to check the modsig_ signature, d-modsig_ (the hash)
   must be included in the measurement list.  The :ref:`ima-modsig`
   template does this.

When there is no appended signature, this field will have a
:ref:`hash-length` of zero.

.. _d-ngv2:

d-ngv2
^^^^^^

``d-ngv2`` contains a 4-byte length + prefix + hash algorithm +
:ref:`file-data-hash`. The length is that of the prefix and hash
algorithm, the nul terminator, and the digest.

See :ref:`ima-hash` for hash algorithm strings.

The legal values for the prefix, determined by the :ref:`digest-type`
policy rule, are:

* ``ima:``
* ``verity``

Examples of the prefix and hash algorithm are below. There is one nul
terminator after the second ``:``.

::

   ima:sha256:
   verity:sha256:

.. _n:

n
^^^^^

``n`` is a file name within the ``ima`` template. ``n`` cannot be used
in custom template.

Unlike :ref:`n-ng`:

* The file name is not nul terminated.
* If the length is greater than 255, the path is removed and only the
  file name is recorded.

See :ref:`n-ng` :ref:`file-name` for the description.

.. _n-ng:

n-ng
^^^^

File Name Length
''''''''''''''''

This is a 4-byte integer representing the length of the file name,
including the nul terminator. The maximum value is MAXPATHLEN +1,
currently 4097.

   Note that there is often redundancy, in that the file name is nul
   terminated. This can be checked for consistency.

.. _file-name:

File Name
''''''''''''''''

For ``n-ng``, this is a nul terminated string representing the name of
the file that was measured.

The file name accurately records the full path that the kernel used to
access the file. Because that path can be a hard or soft link, it may
not represent the actual file location.

The file name is useful for forensics when the verifier detects an
error.  Typical errors are:

* a file data hash is not on an approved list
* the file is not signed when required
* the file is signed with an unknown public key
* the file signature verification failed

.. _sig:

sig
^^^

This field contains the file :ref:`signature`. This field describes
the :ref:`signature-hash-algorithm`.  The signature algorithm is
derived from the public key, which is in turn derived from the
:ref:`public-key-identifier`.

This field holds the extended attribute signature, never the appended
signature.  See :ref:`modsig`.

For the :ref:`extended-verification-module`, it holds the signature
over the meta-data.

* If ``security.ima`` has a file data signature, it is used.

* Else, if ``security.ima`` has a hash, then

   - If ``security.evm`` is a portable signature, it is used.

   - Else the is no signature.

The ``security.evm`` portable signature is over the file meta-data.

An example for add a ``security.evm`` portable signature is at
:ref:`evmctl-portable-signature`.

IMA supports several signature algorithms, including:

* RSA-2048
* ECSA
* ECRDSA (GOST)
* SM2

Signature Length
''''''''''''''''

This is a 4-byte integer representing the total length of the Signature
Header and Signature fields. The value may be zero, indicating that
those two fields are not present.

Signature Header
''''''''''''''''

This field is fixed at 9 bytes, consisting of 5 fields.

* :ref:`signature-type`
* :ref:`signature-version`
* :ref:`signature-hash-algorithm`
* :ref:`public-key-identifier`
* :ref:`signature-size`

These fields do not encode the signature algorithm. That is determined
by mapping the :ref:`public-key-identifier` to the signing
certificate, which contains the signature algorithm.


.. _signature-type:

Signature Type
_____________________

This is a 1-byte field.

The legal values are:

* ``0x03`` EVM_IMA_XATTR_DIGSIG

  For this vakue, the :ref:`signature-version` is always 0x02.

* ``0x05`` EVM_XATTR_PORTABLE_DIGSIG

  This indicates that the signature is the portable signature of EVM file meta-data. 

* ``0x06`` IMA_VERITY_DIGSIG

  This is a signature over the fs-verity file
  digest. :ref:`signature-version` is always 0x03.

.. _signature-version:

Signature Version
_____________________

This is a 1-byte field.

The legal values are:

* ``0x02`` file digest
* ``0x03`` verity file digest

.. _signature-hash-algorithm:

Hash Algorithm
_____________________

This is a 1-byte field representing the hash algorithm used for the File
Data Hash.

The values are:

- ``0x00``: MD4
- ``0x01``: MD5
- ``0x02``: SHA-1
- ``0x03``: RIPEMD-160
- ``0x04``: SHA-256
- ``0x05``: SHA-384
- ``0x06``: SHA-512
- ``0x07``: SHA-225
- ``0x08``: RIPEMD-128
- ``0x09``: RIPEMD-256
- ``0x0a``: RIPEMD-320
- ``0x0b``: Whirlpool-256
- ``0x0c``: Whirlpool-384
- ``0x0d``: Whirlpool-512
- ``0x0e``: Tiger-128	(removed from kernel)
- ``0x0f``: Tiger-160	(removed from kernel)
- ``0x10``: Tiger-192	(removed from kernel)
- ``0x11``: SM3-256
- ``0x12``: Streebog-256
- ``0x13``: Streebog-512

   Note that there is redundancy, in that this field must be consistent
   with the Hash Algorithm field on the Template Data.

.. _public-key-identifier:

Public Key Identifier
_____________________

This is a 4-byte field that identifies the public key. It is the last 4
bytes of the key's X.509 certificate Subject Key Identifier.

.. _signature-size:

Signature Size
_____________________

This is a 2-byte integer representing the size of the Signature field.

    Note that there is redundancy, in that this field must be
    consistent with the signing public key pointed to by the
    :ref:`public-key-identifier`.

.. _log-signature:

Signature
'''''''''

This field represents the signature over the File Data Hash using the
key specified by the Public Key Identifier and the hash algorithm
represented by the (two) Hash Algorithm fields.


.. _evmsig:

evmsig
^^^^^^^^^^^

``evmsig`` follows the format of :ref:`sig`.  The
:ref:`signature-type` is ``0x05`` EVM_XATTR_PORTABLE_DIGSIG.

.. _buf:

buf
^^^

``buf`` is a 4 byte length plus a buffer.

.. warning::

   What is the maximum length of this field?

The buffer contains a variable length buffer whose contents is
determined by the :ref:`n-ng` field. The :ref:`n-ng` field
is not a file name.

When triggered by the measure :ref:`func-key-check` policy rule, it
measures data as it is loaded on different
:ref:`keyrings`. The :ref:`n-ng` field is the nul terminated name:

* :ref:`dot-ima-1`
* :ref:`dot-builtin-trusted-keys-1`
* :ref:`dot-blacklist-1`
* others to be documented

When triggered by the measure :ref:`func-critical-data` policy rule,
it measures data such as the SELinux state. The :ref:`n-ng` field
may be:

* ``selinux-state`` - 
* ``selinux-policy-hash`` - 

.. warning::

   Define the meaning of the strings.

When triggered by the measure :ref:`func-kexec-cmdline` policy rule,
the :ref:`n-ng` field is

* :ref:`kexec-cmdline-1`


::

   measure func=KEXEC_CMDLINE
   measure func=CRITICAL_DATA

.. warning::

   document the ``boot_aggregate`` measurement somewhere.  What triggers it?

.. _dot-ima-1:

.ima
''''

If the file name is ``.ima``, ``buf`` is a DER encoded X.509 IMA certificate.

.. _dot-builtin-trusted-keys-1:

.builtin_trusted_keys
'''''''''''''''''''''

If the file name is ``.builtin_trusted_keys``, ``buf`` is a DER encoded X.509
built-in certificate.

.. _dot-blacklist-1:

.blacklist
''''''''''''''''

If the file name is ``.blacklist``, 

.. warning::

   Keys and hashes added to the :ref:`dot-blacklist` keyring.

   What is the contents of buf? A sample had a 32-byte value which
   appeared to be a hash. If so, where does the hash algorithm come from?

.. _kexec-cmdline-1:


kexec-cmdline
'''''''''''''''''''''

If the file name is ``kexec-cmdline``, ``buf`` is a non-nul terminated
string of boot command line arguments.

This measurement is triggered by func=KEXEC_CMDLINE and a kexec()
call.

.. _modsig:

modsig
^^^^^^^^^^^^

``modsig`` is a PKCS#7 DER encoding of the appended signature. See the CMS
document as in RFC 5652.

For appended signatures, ``modsig`` typically requires :ref:`d-modsig`,
the :ref:`file-data-hash` calculated omiting the appended signture.

When there is no appended signature, this field will have a length of
zero.

See the :ref:`ima-modsig` template for limitations.  The
:ref:`sign-file-appended-signature` utility can add an appended
signature.


.. _uuid:

uuid
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. warning::

    (undocumented)

.. _iuid:

iuid
^^^^^^^^^^^^

``iuid`` is a 4-byte length plus the file user ID as in etc/passwd.

This measures the user ID of the original, actual file, not the
idmapped user ID within a container.


.. _igid:

igid
^^^^^^^^^^^^

``iuid`` is a 4-byte length plus the file group ID as in etc/passwd.

This measures the group ID of the original, actual file, not the
idmapped group ID within a container.

.. _imode:

imode
^^^^^^^^^^^^

``imode`` is a 4-byte length plus the file mode (e.g., user, group,
other).

.. _xattrnames:

xattrnames
^^^^^^^^^^^^

``xattrnames`` is a 4-byte length and a nul termnated text list of
xattr names (separated by ``|``).  The length can be zero if no xattrs
are present.

   Note: :ref:`xattrnames`, :ref:`xattrlengths`, and
   :ref:`xattrvalues` must be specified together.

For example names, see :ref:`extended-verification-module`.

.. warning::

   This documentation needs a full specification of for each name's
   contents.

.. _xattrlengths:

xattrlengths
^^^^^^^^^^^^

``xattrlengths`` is a 4-byte length plus a list of the 4-byte lengths
of the :ref:`xattrvalues` fields. The order of the lengths is
determined by the order of the :ref:`xattrnames`.

   Note: :ref:`xattrnames`, :ref:`xattrlengths`, and
   :ref:`xattrvalues` must be specified together.

   Note: There are several redundant fields that should be validated
   by the verifier.

   * The number of :ref:`xattrnames` multiplied by 4 should equal the
     value of the ``xattrlengths`` length.
   * The sum of the 4-byte lengths of the :ref:`xattrvalues` fields
     should equal the 4-byte length of the :ref:`xattrvalues` field.

.. _xattrvalues:

xattrvalues
^^^^^^^^^^^^

``xattrvalues`` is a 4-byte length of all the values plus a list of
values. The order and content of the values are determined by the
:ref:`xattrnames` field.  Their lengths are determined by the
:ref:`xattrlengths` field.

   Note: :ref:`xattrnames`, :ref:`xattrlengths`, and
   :ref:`xattrvalues` must be specified together.

     Note: There is redundancy that should be validated
     by the verifier.

     * The number of fields should equal the number of names in
       :ref:`xattrnames`.
     * The 4-byte length of the ``xattrvalues`` field should equal the
       sum of the content fields.

Integer Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Multi-byte integer values (PCR index, length, etc.) are in the byte
order of the host where the event log was created. The sender can
convert to network byte order before transmission, as long as the values
are not hashed. For values that are hashed, the receiver must know the
