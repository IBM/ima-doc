Policy Samples
======================

This section includes contributed samples of a
:ref:`boot-time-custom-policy` or :ref:`run-time-custom-policy`.

Each contribution should be a stand alone .rst file and include:

#. The use case, the rationale for the policy.
#. An explanation of nearly each line of the policy.
#. The complete policy, i.e., not a snippet. A policy can
   include comments with the ``#`` character.
